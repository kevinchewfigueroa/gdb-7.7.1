Warnings are being returned in regards to missing dependencies and preventing successful makes:

makeinfo
No curses library functions found
You can install makeinfo by running:
sudo apt-get install texinfo
NOTE: that is not a typo, there is only one t in texinfo

You can install missing curses library functions by running:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

You will then need to reclone the gdb-7.7.1. Simply running ./configure again does not update the configuration.
with the added dependencies. From here follow the remaining instructions in the README.


README for GNU development tools

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file gdb/README.
If with a binutils release, see binutils/README;  if with a libg++ release,
see libg++/README, etc.  That'll give you info about this
package -- supported targets, how to use it, how to report bugs, etc.

Before you get started ensure that you have the required libraries:
	sudo apt-get install flex
	sudo apt-get install bison

It is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of
tools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure 
	make

To install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),
then do:
	make install

(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make

Much of the code and documentation enclosed is copyright by
the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  See the file COPYING or
COPYING.LIB in the various directories, for a description of the
GNU General Public License terms under which you can copy the files.

REPORTING BUGS: Again, see gdb/README, binutils/README, etc., for info
on where and how to report problems.
